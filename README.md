# Not-very-good-version-of-java-tic-tac-toe

Hello, this is Tran Nam Son! This is my first project after first semester at Hanu University.

Before, I always knew, doing helps me learn a lot faster that just implementing knowledge and boring notes. But only when I do projects that I realised it's so true!

The code is not that good yet! As this is a 2 players game. Sooner or later, I will release a version where we can play with machine. That would be DOPE!
